# Cloud Information Systems
Prof. Dr. Viktor Leis discusses the similarities between electricity as a commodity and cloud computing. He emphasizes the benefits of cloud computing, such as cost savings, scalability, elasticity, resource decoupling, expertise, high-level services, and flexibility. However, he also addresses the realities, such as high costs, vendor lock-in, limited control, and unpredictable performance. 

The move to cloud represents a significant change in infrastructure, which comes with opportunities and challenges. The professor outlines two potential future scenarios: 
- Utopia: Commodity-like, cheap, and interoperable cloud services driving technological innovation
- Dystopia: A small number of "hyperscalers" dominating the market, leading to technological stagnation and high costs due to monopoly or oligopoly rents

The professor underscores that to use the cloud effectively, one must think economically. This course aims to provide students with the ability to understand and analyze public cloud services and design cost-efficient and scalable information systems using public clouds.

## Course Organization
The course includes lectures, exercises, and question sessions. Topics include foundational technologies, cloud-native information systems architecture, cost optimization in public clouds, multi-cloud deployments, and implications of SaaS.

## Foundations
The professor introduces various aspects of cloud computing like Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS). He explains the concept of data centers, networking, virtualization, storage, and other compute abstractions like containers and "Serverless" Functions as a Service (FaaS). 

Economic factors motivating the move to the cloud and the implications of virtualization and storage for cloud computing are also discussed. 

The course materials include recommended literature and resources from Prof. Comer, Prof. Klimovic, Prof. Alonso, and Prof. Boncz.
